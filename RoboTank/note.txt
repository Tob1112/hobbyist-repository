if upload program to Arduino failed with a synch error, then check if the correct serial port is selected : Tools -> Serial Port

If input command in the serial prompt and get no reponse, check:
1. jumpers on the motor shield should be PWRIN, instead of VIN
2. check baud rate of the serial monitor, which should be 9600
